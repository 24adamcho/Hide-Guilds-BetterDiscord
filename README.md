# Hide-Guilds-BetterDiscord
BetterDiscord theme to hide the guild bar. 
For best results, put Discord on your leftmost monitor. That way, you can just slap your mouse on the far side to open the guild list.
## What it does
 - Mouse hover reveals guild list
 - Member list slides out from right
   - note: could not figure out how to make it slide back in when deleted without using js
 - Moves ping notification numbers and event bubbles to the left, where they are visible even when the guilds are collapsed.

Relevant sections are commented.
